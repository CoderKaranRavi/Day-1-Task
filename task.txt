1)Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
Introduction:
In the vast ecosystem of the World Wide Web, the protocols governing communication between clients and servers play a crucial role. Two prominent versions of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that have shaped the web's evolution are HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2. In this blog, we'll embark on a journey to explore the key differences between these two protocols and understand how HTTP/2 has revolutionized web performance.
HTTP/1.1: The Foundation of the Modern Web:
HTTP/1.1 has been the workhorse of the internet for over a decade. This protocol governs the way browsers request resources from servers and how servers respond. However, as the web evolved and became more complex, the limitations of HTTP/1.1 became apparent.
1.Connection Multiplexing:
•	HTTP/1.1 relies on a single connection for each resource, leading to a phenomenon known as head-of-line blocking. This means that if a resource is slow to load, it can delay the loading of subsequent resources.
•	The result is a slower user experience, especially on websites with numerous assets.
2.Header Overhead:
•	Each HTTP/1.1 request and response carries a significant amount of header information. This redundant header data consumes bandwidth and slows down the loading of pages.
3.No Built-in Compression:
•	HTTP/1.1 lacks native support for header compression, resulting in a larger data payload for each request and response.
HTTP/2: Transforming Web Performance:
Recognizing the limitations of HTTP/1.1, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) introduced HTTP/2 in 2015, with a primary goal of improving web performance. Here are some key features that set HTTP/2 apart
1.Multiplexing:
•	HTTP/2 introduces a revolutionary concept called multiplexing, allowing multiple streams of data to be sent and received concurrently over a single connection.
•	This eliminates the head-of-line blocking issue, significantly improving the loading speed of web pages with multiple resources.
2.Header Compression:
•	To address the issue of header overhead, HTTP/2 employs header compression, reducing the size of header information and optimizing bandwidth usage
3.Binary Protocol:
•	Unlike the text-based nature of HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol, making it more efficient to parse and reducing latency.
4.Server Push:
•	HTTP/2 introduces server push, enabling servers to push resources to the client's cache before they are explicitly requested. This minimizes round-trip delays and accelerates page loading times.
Conclusion:
In the dynamic landscape of the web, the transition from HTTP/1.1 to HTTP/2 represents a significant leap forward in terms of performance and efficiency. The adoption of HTTP/2 by major browsers and web servers has been widespread, leading to a faster and more responsive online experience for users.
While HTTP/1.1 laid the foundation for modern web communication, HTTP/2 has emerged as a game-changer, addressing the shortcomings of its predecessor and setting the stage for future innovations. As technology continues to advance, the quest for even faster and more efficient web protocols persists, shaping the digital landscape we navigate daily.

2) Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in JavaScript
Introduction
JavaScript, the versatile and widely used programming language, is renowned for its object-oriented nature. At the heart of this paradigm lies the concept of objects and their internal representation. In this blog, we will delve into the intricacies of how JavaScript handles objects, exploring their internal representation and shedding light on the mechanisms that make them an indispensable part of the language.
Understanding Objects in JavaScript
In JavaScript, everything is an object, be it a primitive type or a complex structure. Objects in JavaScript are containers for named values, called properties or methods. These properties can be primitive data types, objects, or functions, making JavaScript a powerful and flexible language for building a wide range of applications.
Internal Representation of Objects
•	To comprehend the internal representation of objects in JavaScript, it's crucial to understand how objects are stored and accessed in memory.
•	Object Literal Syntax: Objects can be defined using the literal syntax, where key-value pairs are enclosed within curly braces. This syntax makes it easy to create and initialize objects.
•	Property Descriptors: Each property in a JavaScript object is associated with a property descriptor. This descriptor contains information about the property, such as whether it is writable, enumerable, or configurable.
•	Prototypes and Inheritance: JavaScript objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects through prototypes. This forms the basis of JavaScript's prototypal inheritance model.
•	Object Representation in Memory: JavaScript engines use various techniques to represent objects in memory. Objects can be stored as hash tables, allowing for efficient property lookup. The actual implementation details may vary across different JavaScript engines (V8, Spider Monkey, etc.).
Conclusion
Objects are the building blocks of JavaScript, providing a flexible and dynamic way to structure and represent data. Understanding the internal representation of objects is crucial for writing efficient and maintainable code. As you continue your journey in JavaScript development, consider exploring advanced topics such as object cloning, object manipulation, and design patterns that leverage the power of objects. Embrace the object-oriented paradigm, and you'll unlock the true potential of JavaScript for crafting robust and scalable applications.
